## Summary
An overview of the findings, including the number of vulnerabilities identified and a brief description of the overall security posture.

### high-level findings  

#### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**
- **Severity**: High
- **Description**: The `_executeWithdrawal` function updates the state after making an external call, which can lead to reentrancy attacks.
- **Affected Function**: `_executeWithdrawal`
- **Recommendation**: Update the state before making external calls.

```solidity
function _executeWithdrawal(
    MarketState memory state,
    address accountAddress,
    uint32 expiry,
    uint baseCalldataSize
) internal returns (uint256) {
    WithdrawalBatch memory batch = _withdrawalData.batches[expiry];
    // Ensure state is updated before external calls
    if (expiry >= block.timestamp && !state.isClosed) {
        revert_WithdrawalBatchNotExpired();
    }
    // Proceed with withdrawal logic...
}
```

#### 2. **Improper Access Control**
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Description**: The `_queueWithdrawal` function does not check if the caller is authorized to queue withdrawals.
- **Affected Function**: `_queueWithdrawal`
- **Recommendation**: Implement access control to restrict who can call this function.

```solidity
function _queueWithdrawal(
    MarketState memory state,
    Account memory account,
    address accountAddress,
    uint104 scaledAmount,
    uint normalizedAmount,
    uint baseCalldataSize
) internal returns (uint32 expiry) {
    require(msg.sender == accountAddress, "Unauthorized access");
    // Proceed with queuing logic...
}
```

#### 3. **Lack of Input Validation**
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Description**: The `executeWithdrawal` function does not validate the `expiry` parameter against existing withdrawal batches.
- **Affected Function**: `executeWithdrawal`
- **Recommendation**: Add checks to ensure `expiry` corresponds to a valid withdrawal batch.

```solidity
function executeWithdrawal(
    address accountAddress,
    uint32 expiry
) public nonReentrant sphereXGuardExternal returns (uint256) {
    require(_withdrawalData.batches[expiry].scaledTotalAmount > 0, "Invalid expiry");
    // Proceed with withdrawal execution...
}
```

#### 4. **Use of `block.timestamp`**
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Description**: The use of `block.timestamp` for time calculations can be manipulated by miners.
- **Affected Function**: `_processExpiredWithdrawalBatch`
- **Recommendation**: Consider using a more reliable method for time tracking or limit the use of `block.timestamp`.

```solidity
function _processExpiredWithdrawalBatch(MarketState memory state) internal {
    uint32 expiry = state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry;
    require(expiry < block.timestamp, "Batch not expired");
    // Proceed with processing logic...
}
```


### low-level findings  

#### 1. **Event Emission for State Changes**
- **Severity**: Low
- **Description**: The `_queueWithdrawal` function does not emit an event when a withdrawal is queued.
- **Affected Function**: `_queueWithdrawal`
- **Recommendation**: Emit an event to log when a withdrawal is queued.

```solidity
function _queueWithdrawal(
    MarketState memory state,
    Account memory account,
    address accountAddress,
    uint104 scaledAmount,
    uint normalizedAmount,
    uint baseCalldataSize
) internal returns (uint32 expiry) {
    // Existing logic...
    emit WithdrawalQueued(accountAddress, expiry, scaledAmount);
}
```
